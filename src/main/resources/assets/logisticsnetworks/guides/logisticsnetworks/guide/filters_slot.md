# Slot Filter

Slot Filter limits inventory slot access for item transfer.

Slot range is 0 to 53.

Input format examples:

1. `0, 1, 2`
2. `4-9`
3. `0,1,4-9`

Behavior:

1. Whitelist mode allows only listed slots.
2. Blacklist mode blocks listed slots.

The same logic is applied on both ends:

1. Export source slots for extraction
2. Import target slots for insertion

This filter is used by item transfer path only.
