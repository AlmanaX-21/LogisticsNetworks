# NBT Filter

NBT Filter stores one selected path and one exact value.

Setup flow:

1. Put an item or fluid container in extractor slot.
2. Pick a path from the detected list.
3. The value at that path is stored on the filter.

Match is exact equality on the selected value.

Target types in UI:

1. Items
2. Fluids
3. Chemicals

Current code supports matching for Items and Fluids.
There is no chemical NBT matching implementation right now.
